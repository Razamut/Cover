1. CreateDatabases : takes existing csv files and create sqlite databases.  
the rest of the modules require the sqlite databases.
2. LoanSummary : reports high level summary of loans  
3. LoanDueDates : will compute outstanding loans and due dates

Usage
=====

The successful execution of CreateDatabases is required for the successful implementation  
of the other modules. All execution commands are in curly braces in each module.
Eventually, some of those will be used to build executable functions.  
For now simply copy and paste the commands in your cli.
